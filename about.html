    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>
        Since its inception in 2021, Medical Impact Uganda, has been supporting rural and peri-urban healthcare entrepreneurs with the financing they need to acquire high quality medical equipment and make infrastructure upgrades so that they can provide secondary and tertiary care to their patients. MI-UG started as a repsonse to the acute shortage, and in many instances, complete absence of advanced healthcare  for communities living outside rural areas in Uganda.
    </p>
    <h1>Our Mission and Vision</h1>
    <p>
        In Uganda, while more than 80% of the population reside outside urban areas, nearly 75% of all private health facilities are located in a few towns and cities, serving less than 10% of the patient population. Therefore, patients in rural areas must contend with the inefficiency and acute inadequacy of the public healthcare system for all their treatment needs.

We have designed our range of products and services to support medical profesionals and healthcare entrepreneurs to reach patient populations in rural and peri-urban areas.</p>

Our interventions are broadly categorized as follows:
