    <h1>Tech-Enabled Solutions for Rural Healthcare </h1>
    <p>
        At Medical Impact Uganda our mission is to use simple mobile technologies to bring affordable, high quality healthcare to every village in Africa. We deploy telehealth-enabled containerized clinics within villages that otherwise have no clinic within a 25-kilometer radius. Our work ensures that healthcare entrepreneurs and their SMEs who are serving peri-urban and rural communities have access to qualified healthcare professionals as well as critical equipment in order to provide advanced medical care.
