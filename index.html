    <h1>Tech-Enabled Solutions for Rural Healthcare in Uganda and the whole of East Africa.</h1>
    <p>
        At Medical Impact Uganda our mission is to use simple mobile technologies to bring affordable, high quality healthcare to every village in Africa. We deploy telehealth-enabled containerized clinics within villages that otherwise have no clinic within a 25-kilometer radius. Our work ensures that healthcare entrepreneurs and their SMEs who are serving peri-urban and rural communities have access to qualified healthcare professionals as well as critical equipment in order to provide advanced medical care.

    <h2>Telehealth Support</h2>
    <p>In Uganda, more than 75% of healthcare professionals serve in major urban areas. 80% of the population lives outside urban areas and have limited access to healthcare. By providing affordable remote consultations, telehealth solutions bridge this gap for rural and peri-urban patient populations.</p>

    <h2>Off-Grid Solutions</h2>
    <p>In a country where only about 15% of the population has access to electricity, healthcare facilities located outside major towns and cities are limited in the range and sophistication of services they ca provide. Our off-grid renewable energy solutions help SMEs access medical-grade solar &amp; biogas products to thrive. </p>
